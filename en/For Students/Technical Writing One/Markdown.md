<h1>Markdown (optional)</h1>

> Estimated Time: 10 minutes

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that many technical professionals use to create and edit technical documents. With Markdown, you write text in a plain text editor (such as vi or Emacs), inserting special characters to create headers, boldface, bullets, and so on. For example, the following example shows a simple technical document formatted with Markdown:

```
## bash and ksh

**bash** closely resembles an older shell named **ksh**.  The key
*practical* difference between the two shells is as follows:

*  More people know bash than ksh, so it is easier to get help for bash
   problems than ksh problems.
   ```

The rendered version of the preceding technical document looks as follows:

> <h2>bash and ksh</h2>
> bash closely resembles an older shell named ksh. The key practical difference between the two shells is as follows:

> * More people know bash than ksh, so it is easier to get help for bash problems than ksh problems.
A Markdown parser converts Markdown files into HTML. Browsers can then display the resulting HTML to readers.

We recommend becoming comfortable with Markdown by taking one of the following tutorials:
