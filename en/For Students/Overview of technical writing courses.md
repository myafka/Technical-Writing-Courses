| second             | [Technical Writing Two](Technical%20Writing%20Two) | intermediate topics in technical writing |   1 hour  | 2 to 2.5 hours |


The pre-class components introduce topics; the in-class components help students integrate those topics. That said, the pre-class lessons on their own still provide a valuable educational experience.

We've aimed *Technical Writing One* and *Technical Writing Two* at the following audiences:
* software engineers
* software engineering students

Additionally, many people in engineering-adjacent roles (such as product managers) have also benefited from these courses.
